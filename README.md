# Volleyball Statistics Tracker
### An application catered towards tracking the progression of volleyball players.

<br>

***Who is this application made for?***

This application is catered towards competitive volleyball
teams that strive to keep track of their progression in the sport. 


***Who would use it?***

This application would mainly be operated by coaches, 
and team managers during games. The output of this application 
would be catered towards the players to see what volleyball skill
they would need to improve.

***Why is this project of interest to me?***

I personally love volleyball, and played it competitively. Although 
I have seen my fair share of statistic trackers, I find they can be
extremely complicated towards the user. 

While playing competitive volleyball, I also used statistic trackers
in order to see what skill I needed to work on the most.
